# UI Component Template

To create a new composite UI component:

1. Copy the Card folder
2. Rename files and component names
3. Keep the same file structure
4. Split responsibilities into subcomponents
5. Export only from index.ts
6. Use composition via Object.assign
7. Do not introduce new patterns
8. Do not add public exports
9. Do not abstract prematurely

If unsure, follow Card exactly.
