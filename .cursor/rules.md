This project follows strict frontend contracts.

Before writing code:

1. Read contracts in src/contracts
2. Treat contracts as reference-only
3. Do NOT import from contracts
4. Reproduce patterns locally
5. Follow Card as the canonical UI example

If unsure:

- Copy structure, not code
- Prefer consistency over creativity
