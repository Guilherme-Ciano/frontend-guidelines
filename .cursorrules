This project is strictly opinionated.

- React Query is used ONLY in services
- Zustand is ONLY for UI/global state
- Forms use react-hook-form + zod
- No API calls inside components
- shadcn components are wrapped, never used directly
- Tailwind classes only inside shared/ui
- If a similar pattern exists, copy it exactly
- Do not invent abstractions

Composite UI components MUST follow composition pattern.

- Header, Body, Footer are separate files
- index.ts exports a composed component
- <Card.Header /> is mandatory
- Large components in a single file are forbidden
- Follow existing UI components exactly
